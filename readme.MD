# Complete Note.js Developer Course Workflow
## Along with basic node.js practice

#### -node engine can create much faster machine code ( v8 engine )
#### -node is a js runtime that uses the v8 engine, v8 is written in c++
#### -v8 converts the code to machine code

#### -learned about using arguments/user inputs as process.argv and yargs
#### -const argv = yargs.argv is one of the best way for user input argument parsing
#### -var command = process.argv[2] or alternative way is: var command = argv._[0];

#### -using filesystem to read and write json file along with converting json/string
#### -using simple array, notes as json data added to a file and also checked if the file has duplicate notes or not

#### -modified previous version of code with re-usable functions and in a proper way to handle error messages
#### -basically creating and saving notes has been done properly
